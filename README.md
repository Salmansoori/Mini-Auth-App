# Authentication mini UI React App

This is a simple React application that serves as the UI part of an authentication app. It includes the following components:

- **Login Form**
- **Signup Form**
- **Home Page**
- ""Login Form in modal""
- ""Signup form in modal"

Code Overview
The application is structured around routing, with the main App component responsible for displaying different components based on the current route. The components folder contains five key components, each serving a specific function within the app:

- Login Component: Handles the login form, allowing users to input their credentials and log in to the application.
- Signup Component: Manages the signup form, enabling new users to create an account by providing necessary details.
- Home Component: Displays all posts or content relevant to the logged-in user, acting as the main content area after authentication.
- InputField Component: A reusable component designed to create input fields dynamically based on the field type, ensuring consistency across forms.
- Modal Component: Provides a modal window to display content or other components in an overlay, enhancing user interaction by focusing attention on important actions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
